# Agent Guidelines for savetoink

This repository contains the code for the savetoink application, composed of:

1. Golang API HTTP backend in [cmd/lambda](cmd/lambda).
2. Frontend web application in [cmd/webapp](cmd/webapp).
3. Browser extension in [cmd/extension](cmd/extension).

## Development Guidelines

- APIs currently unstable so no need to keep any backward compatibility
- **ALWAYS** run `just lint test` and fix issues before considering a change ready for user review.
- **ALWAYS** add new tests for any new functionality.
- **NEVER** ignore linting errors via `//nolint` statements or similar tricks without prompting the user for permission.
- prefer lowercase log and error messages
- don't use any CSS for webapp development for now
